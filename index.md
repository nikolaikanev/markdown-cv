## Summery

Since I've passed through some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Excell courses and I consider myself a practical learner, I'd love to work on digital projects that leave me space for improvements.

### Technologies

HTML, CSS, Google sheet, Excel formulas, Javascript basics, Photoshop lightbox

## Professional Experience

### Content inputer

`April 2020 - September 2020`

In Bakalin I used a number of tools as Google sheets, Django admin, Trello, Slack and Photoshop lightroom. I improved my skills in writing excel formulas, which was a key part of my work as a data inputter. I also learned a lot about work processes.


## Courses
